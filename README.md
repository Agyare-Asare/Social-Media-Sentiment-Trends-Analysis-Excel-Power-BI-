# Social Media Sentiment Trends Analysis (Excel & Power BI)
## Project Overview
Social media platforms generate huge amounts of user opinions every day. This project explores how sentiment varies across different social media platforms and posting times, with the aim of identifying overall emotional trends and behavioral patterns.
Using labeled sentiment data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, the analysis focuses on understanding when users are more likely to post positive, neutral, or negative content and how sentiment differs by platform and time of day.
The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore sentiment patterns over time.
